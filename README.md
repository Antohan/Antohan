### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton.
I am a web developer since 2017

My favorite technologies are **React**, **Node.js**

If you want a sample of my code, send me a take home assignment instead of poking around here since the public part of my GitHub repos are rather unmaintained.
Thanks!

My `npm` packages:
- Node.js [Simple async spawn](https://github.com/Antohan/simple-async-spawn) - Runs given command in child process asynchronously.
- Vue [Confirm Plugin](https://github.com/Antohan/vue-confirm-plugin) - Async wrapper for Vue component (Good for modal windows).
