### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anton.
I am a web developer since 2017

My favorite technologies are **React** and **Vue**.

If you are an employer and you are interested in my developer skills, you can see my code in the following repositories:

**React**:
- [Filtered list](https://github.com/Antohan/filtered-list)

**Vue**:
- [Vue boilerplate](https://github.com/Antohan/vue-ts-boilerplate)


My `npm` packages:
- Node.js [Simple async spawn](https://github.com/Antohan/simple-async-spawn) - Runs given command in child process asynchronously.
- Vue [Confirm Plugin](https://github.com/Antohan/vue-confirm-plugin) - Async wrapper for Vue component (Good for modal windows).
